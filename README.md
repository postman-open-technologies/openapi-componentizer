  This is a GSoC 2023 project. Initial project is proposed at [Postman Open Technologies GSoC 2023](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023/issues/9)
  
**Mentoring organization:** [Postman](https://www.postman.com)

**Organizer:** [Postman Open Technologies](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies)

**Mentors:** [Bala Avulapati](https://github.com/bavulapati), [Darshan Sen](https://github.com/RaisinTen), [Arvind Kalra](https://github.com/arvindkalra08)

**OpenAPI Specification Lead:** [Mike Ralphson](https://github.com/MikeRalphson)

## Product Requirements
  What are the functions and features required?
- A Command Line Interface (**CLI**) tool and library taking one or more OpenAPI 3.x specifications in JSON or YAML (YAML is a superset of JSON so you can read JSON with any YAML parser) and producing the either one OpenAPI document with all the common [components](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/specification/components.html) moved to the `components` section (in the case of a single input file) or moved to a new common OAS document's `components` section (in the case of two or more input files).
- **Good to have requirement**: CLI's capability to accept the list of components to list under common components. This can be via CLI parameters.
- **Good to have requirement**: Capability to preserve comments in the components
- **Good to have requirement**: Capability to identify similar components and prompting user to confirm, before producing the output. The similarity detection can consider component description and other fields.

## Process Requirements
  How people interact with a product and how a product interacts with other (often existing) business processes?
- Users should be able to find the tool via online search, with an intention to improve and simplify the OpenAPI specification. This tool can sit next to the [existing tools](https://tools.openapis.org/) in the OpenAPI ecosystems.
- **Good to have**: While generating OpenAPI specification from code or collections on Postman, Postman should be able to use this tool to simplify the specification.
- **Tech Stack:** We are thinking about Typescript, Go or C++, as the team has people familiar with this but we will consider the comfort of the contributors.
- **Distribution**: How we distribute the tool depends on the tech stack we choose. We will revisit this when we decide the tech stack.

## Note about AI usage

The use of Artificial Intelligence is discouraged either in your contributions or proposal preparation, as it doesnâ€™t help us learn at the early stage in the open source community. The contributors or applicants of GSoC can include a paragraph in their proposal, that it has been written without the help of AI.
